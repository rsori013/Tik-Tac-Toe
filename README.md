# Tik-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe is a simple game that can be played on a 3x3 grid. Here are the basic rules:

The game is played by two players, X and O.
Players take turns placing their respective mark (X or O) on the grid.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If the grid is filled and no one has won, the game is a draw.
A few tips for playing Tic-tac-toe:

Try to block your opponent from getting three in a row.
Look for opportunities to create a row of three marks for yourself.
Pay attention to what your opponent is doing, and try to anticipate their next move.
The game is relatively simple and easy to learn, but can be challenging to master.
